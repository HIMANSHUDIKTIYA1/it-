<h1>ECOTOURISM BENEFITS</h1>
    <p>One big benefit of ecotourism is that it supports the maintenance and improvement of the areas used as tourist attractions. For instance, the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda generated $16.4 million in 2016 from park entry fees alone. This money was used to hire park rangers and wardens, engage the community, and maintain this important park that’s home to animals like the critically endangered mountain gorilla.</p>
   <h2>SOME OTHER BENEFITS OF ECOTOURISM INCLUDE:
</h2>
<P>Combats climate change. Because ecotourism revolves around natural resources, supporting the industry can help lower carbon emissions. A 2010 study on a cluster of ecotourism land in Peruvian Amazonia found that the land contained between 5.3 and 8.7 million tons of above-ground carbon.
    Incentivizes maintenance of attractions. Ecotourism provides incentives to enhance biodiversity and preserve natural resources.
    Provides locals a source of income. Ecotourism can fight poverty and empower local indigenous communities by creating employment opportunities.
    Promotes conservation. Ecotourism generates revenue, and host communities use this revenue to invest in the natural resources that attract tourists. For instance, Tambopata’s intact tropical forests are at risk of deforestation, but potential ecotourism profits have encouraged local lodge owners to invest in more forested lands and enact conservation efforts to maintain forest cover.
    Educates tourists and locals. Ecotourism activities promote environmental awareness and education among locals and tourists alike.</P>
