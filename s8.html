    <h1>POSITIVE IMPACT OF ECOTOURISM ON PEOPLE</h1>
    <p>Ecotourism can provide local people with employment opportunities, eg park rangers, cooks and cleaners in lodges. This employment provides an income which is often higher than they would receive from selling their crops.
        Education is improved as locals are trained as wildlife guides, improving their family's standard of living and lifestyle.
        Local communities can earn extra income from the creation of handicrafts which they can sell to tourists.
        Ecotourism fosters respect for local cultures and the environment and increases the awareness of conservation.
        Teachers who have taken part in ecotourism trips can teach young people to realise the importance of the principles and practices of ecotourism, promoting cultural understanding and environmental awareness.</p>
